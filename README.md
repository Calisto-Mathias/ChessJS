# ChessJS

A simple, modern chess gameboard built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. This is a project whose main intention is to help me to become a better developer as time goes by.

## Current Progress:

1. Pawn Move Option Tracking has been added through the pawn.js file. On the other hand, the _En Passant_ Move tracking hasn't been implemented yet.
2. Rook Move Option Tracking has also been added for both the white and black pieces of the chess board.

## Side Notes:

- The ID's used for each of the squares is not necessarily in the method of square tracking that is implemented in the chess guidelines/rules.
